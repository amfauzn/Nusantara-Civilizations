### Mandala and Empires
The mandala is a model for describing the patterns of diffuse political power in Southeast Asian history, when local power was more important than the central leadership. It is employed to denote traditional Southeast Asian political formations, such as federation of kingdoms or vassalized polity under a center of domination.
The basic difference between a mandala and an empire is that an empire has multi-level, overlapping jurisdictions, whereas a mandala does not directly intervene with the domestic affairs of its vassal states outside of its core realms.
