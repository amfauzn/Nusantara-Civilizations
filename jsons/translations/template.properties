Long life and salutations to you, Prince Arung Palakka, liberator of Bone and hero to the Buginese people. It was your courageous effort in the 1660 rebellion against Gowa-Tallo dominion that led Bone to freedom, culminating in the Makassar War. By cooperating with the VOC, you succeeded in making Bone the sole ruler of South Sulawesi. Some may consider you a traitor, a hypocrite, and an authoritarian and ruthless leader. But you are still a hero to the Buginese people and stand as a symbol of Bone independence for all time. =
